Clean Version of Working Repository
CA2 for Data Science. Reads in and cleans a file of Northern Ireland postcode data cleans it and also writes a new file for data relating to Limavady.
The second part reads monthly crime statistic data for Northern Ireland, cleans it and for a sample finds the postcodes for the location where the crime happened. Finally does a barplot of the number of crimes per crime type for the sample previously taken.
